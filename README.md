•	What your project is:
Our project is a story on the number of prisoners in solitary confinement across U.S. prisons.
•	Who is in the group:
Chikeze, Shaleen
•	Where your data is coming from:
The 2018 ASCA-Liman Nationwide Survey of Time-in Cell by The Association of State Correctional Administrators and The Liman Center for Public Interest Law at Yale Law School.
•	Your current status in terms of data acquisition/analysis/visualization:
We pulled the data from a pdf and into a csv / excel file with Tabula.
•	Sketch of what the final project might look like, noting any interactivity:
We will make a map showing number of prisoners in solitary confinement by state and group it by gender, race, and other demographical information to see which states have the most restrictive housing prisoners and what demographic they belong to.
